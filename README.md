- 👋 Hi, I’m @mbayeley1.
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the genetic basis of drug resistance in parasites and developing strategies to overcome it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced computational techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze genomic data and uncover patterns and predictors of drug resistance in parasites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that combine computational biology, genomic data analysis, and machine learning to tackle the challenges of drug resistance in parasites.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to [msrtdstw@gmail.com]. I would be excited to connect and discuss potential collaborations in this critical field, leveraging the power of machine learning in our research.
